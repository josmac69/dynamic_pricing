# Dynamic Pricing Methods

## Cost-plus pricing
* Sellers charge consumers the cost to produce a product plus a predetermined profit.
* It's simple to execute but doesn't consider external influences like market reactions or changes in consumer value.
* It's widely used in the US, particularly by companies facing high competition.

- Pricing based on competitors: Businesses monitor their competitors' prices and adjust accordingly. This is common in retail, with companies like Amazon leading the charge. Prices depend on market conditions and firm planning.

- Pricing based on value or elasticity: Companies ideally price a product equal to the consumer-perceived value. Price elasticity measures how sensitive a product is to changes in price. This method aims for volume, revenue, or profit maximization strategies.

- Bundle pricing: Prices depend on whether a product is bundled with something else, which bundle it belongs to, and sometimes the specific customers it is offered to. It's used by industries like print media and software companies.

- Time-based dynamic pricing: Prices change based on the time of day, popular in industries where demand fluctuates throughout the day or where suppliers want to incentivize customers to use a product at a specific time.

  - Time-based retail pricing: Retailers often adjust prices depending on the time of day, typically raising prices during peak shopping hours.

  - Time-based utility pricing: This includes strategies like time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing, real-time pricing, and peak-load reduction credits.

- Conversion-rate pricing: If conversion rates from viewer to buyer are low, prices may be dropped to increase conversions. A good conversion rate indicates a good return on investment.
