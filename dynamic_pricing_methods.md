# Dynamic Pricing Methods

Dynamic pricing is a strategy that allows businesses to adjust their prices in response to market conditions and customer behavior. There are several models and strategies used for dynamic pricing, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages.


## Cost-plus pricing
* Sellers charge consumers the cost to produce a product plus a predetermined profit.
* It's simple to execute but doesn't consider external influences like market reactions or changes in consumer value.
* It's widely used in the US, particularly by companies facing high competition.

## Pricing based on competitors
* Businesses monitor their competitors' prices and adjust accordingly.
* This is common in retail, with companies like Amazon leading the charge.
* Prices depend on market conditions and firm planning.

## Pricing based on value or elasticity
* Companies ideally price a product equal to the consumer-perceived value.
* Price elasticity measures how sensitive a product is to changes in price.
* This method aims for volume, revenue, or profit maximization strategies.

## Bundle pricing
* Prices depend on whether a product is bundled with something else, which bundle it belongs to, and sometimes the specific customers it is offered to.
* It's used by industries like print media and software companies.

## Time-based dynamic pricing
* Prices change based on the time of day, popular in industries where demand fluctuates throughout the day or where suppliers want to incentivize customers to use a product at a specific time.
* Prices may be higher during peak hours or seasons and lower during off-peak times. This strategy is useful for businesses with predictable fluctuations in demand and can help manage capacity and demand more effectively.
  * Time-based retail pricing: Retailers often adjust prices depending on the time of day, typically raising prices during peak shopping hours.
  * Time-based utility pricing: This includes strategies like time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing, real-time pricing, and peak-load reduction credits.

## Conversion-rate pricing
* If conversion rates from viewer to buyer are low, prices may be dropped to increase conversions.
* A good conversion rate indicates a good return on investment.
