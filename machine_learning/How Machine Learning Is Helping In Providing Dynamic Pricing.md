- Dynamic pricing is a strategy of setting product or service prices based on current market conditions. It maximizes opportunities for revenue by adapting to changing market conditions. And it also lowers costs.

- There are three common methods of dynamic pricing: cost-based, competitor-based, and demand-based.

- Challenges in setting the right price includes understanding the state of the market, the competition, and the uniqueness of the product or service.

- Traditional approaches to pricing were largely manual and based on analysis of cost, demand, supply or competition.
  - They included premium pricing (higher than average price) and penetration pricing (lower than market competition).

- Algorithmic pricing uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to set optimal prices for maximizing revenue, increasing profit, or achieving other business goals.

- Dynamic pricing algorithms bring flexibility by enabling retailers to set prices for different groups of shoppers based on various factors like market trends, demand fluctuations, customer behavior, purchasing power, etc.

- The workflow of a typical pricing algorithm includes:
  - processing historical data on price points and demand,
  - building a demand function,
  - generating optimal prices,
  - and repeating the cycle with updated repricing results.

- Dynamic pricing providers use tech approaches like the latest-generation neural networks to ensure accurate price effect prediction.

- The Thompson sampling is a method of dynamic pricing implementation where the algorithm explores and learns the demand function.

- Different modules of dynamic pricing are used for different product categories and market responses:
  - long tail module (for new or long-tail products with little or no historical data), elasticity module (calculates the impact of price on demand),
  - KVI module (manages consumer price perception),
  - competitive-response module (reacts to competitorsâ€™ prices in real-time),
  - omnichannel module (coordinates prices in different channels),
  - time-based pricing module (charges customers more or less at specific times of the day),
  - conversion rate pricing module (lowers price to increase conversion rate if leads aren't turning into sales).

- Dynamic pricing is used in many industries, including retail, travel, hospitality, entertainment, and transportation.
